# **Introduction**
The goal of this project is to classify Chest X-ray images as normal(healthy) or Pneumonia cases using Convolutional neural networks.

Convolutional Neural network is a type of Deep learning algorithm  that performs very well in image classification tasks.

# **Data**
The data is hosted by Kaggle.com at this url [Data source](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).
